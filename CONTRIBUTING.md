## Contributor's Guide

Chronik started out as a personal learning exercise but, even though I probably don't have a chance of getting the cool T-shirt, I thought I would take a chance and let it out into the wild in the spirit of [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).

### Hacktoberfest Pull Request Guidelines

I will apply a Hacktoberfest label to any issues created between October 1, 2017 to October 31, 2017.

Honestly, I don't really know what I'm doing because I'm just learning, but any spammy pull request will be immediately marked invalid or, worse, simply ignored because I don't have the time to deal with random bullshit—and it's not my problem not matter how much you want the T-shirt. Any request that deviates form that Chronik is meant will receive a polite message from me and be marked as invalid.

I'm open to suggestions, though! So if you think that there is a good reason for me to accept your potentially controversial pull request—do make it clear!
